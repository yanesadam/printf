.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.B _printf()
produces output according to a format as described below. It writes output to stdout, the standard output stream. All output is written under the control of a format string. This specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output. It also specifies how arguments accessed via stdarg facilities are converted for output. 
.PP
.SH Return value
Upon successful return, this function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).

.SH Format of the format string
The format string is a character string composed of zero or more directives. Ordinary characters (except %) are copied unchanged to output. %
.I [character] 
is a conversion specifier, the argument of which will be fetched.
